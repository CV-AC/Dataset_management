The **Oulu CMV DATASET managements** empowers our group members to easily access and visit all the existing datasets (both our own datasets and other popular benchmark datasets) rooted at the CSC platform ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê.

## 1. Introduction

We store the datasets on the CSC platform in **two servers** (Puhti and Allas) üêß

### a. [Allas](https://docs.csc.fi/data/Allas/accessing_allas/) for cold storage

üí¨  Allas is for **long-term storage/backup**. The data won't be deleted that easily; unstructured data is accepted (you can put all your trash here).
- [How to upload data to Allas](https://docs.csc.fi/data/Allas/using_allas/cyberduck/)

### b. Puhti/Mahti for hot storage**

[Puhti](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/systems-puhti/) server is used for **hot storage**

üí¨ Puhti is for **handy access for the running experiments**. The data WILL be deleted easily (90 days); unstructured data is NOT accepted (big chunk file is better); fast access
- [How to upload data to Puhti](https://docs.csc.fi/data/moving/graphical_transfer/)

### Tips
- Make sure that you upload your datasets to **both servers for the first time**.
- [Converting between Allas and Puhti/Mahti](https://docs.csc.fi/data/Allas/accessing_allas/#accessing-allas-in-the-csc-computing-environment-and-other-linux-platforms)


## 2. Dataset storage arrangement

So far, we have applied two projects to store the datasets (**MVG_dataset1** and **MVG_dataset2**); we will apply for more depending on the final space used.

Below is the data arrangement:

**MVG_dataset1** 

Project name: MVG_dataset1

Project ID: project_2009201

Content: face datasets

Puhti address:/project_2009201/scratch/

Allas address:project_2009201:default:username

Folder hierarchy (people in charge):

-FER (Xingxun)
 -AffectWild
-MER (Yante)
 -SMIC
 -CASME
-rPPG (Marko)
-Anti-spoofing (Marko)
-Forgery (Yang)
-Others (Haotian)

**MVG_dataset2** 

Project name: MVG_dataset2

Project ID: 

Content: body datasets

Puhti address:/project_2009202/scratch/

Allas address:project_2009202:default:username


Folder hierarchy (people in charge):

-MG (Haoyu)
 -iMiGUE 
 -SMG (70G)
-Action (Atif)
 -Kinectic400
 -NTU60
 -NTU120
-Gesture (Haoyu)
 -Chalearn2014
 -Chalearn2016
-Others (Atif)

**MVG_dataset3**  (TBD)

Project name: MVG_dataset3

Content: EmotionAI-related datasets

Folder hierarchy (people in charge):

-EmotionAI (Hanlin)
-Sundown (Qianru)

**MVG_dataset4** (TBD)

Project name: MVG_dataset4

Content: general datasets

Folder hierarchy (people in charge):

-image (Zhuo)
 -ImageNet
 -CIFAR100
 -CIFAR10
-others

## 3. TO DO LIST
- [X] Basic structure of the dataset management
- [X] Assign the correspondent of each project space
- [X] Finalize the dataset folder structure
- [ ] Confirm all the dataset sizes
- [ ] Complete the dataset credits
- [ ] Upload all the datasets to Allas
- [ ] Upload all the datasets to Puhti/Mahti(/scratch)
- [ ] Apply for extra space for extremely large datasets, like EmotionAI
- [ ] Add more documents 


## 4. Maintenance instructions
- üëâ If you need to change the high-level dataset structure (like Face, General), please contact chen.haoyu@oulu.fi so we can update this README to make it consistent.
- üöÄ [Do with BIG file chunk](https://docs.csc.fi/support/faq/local_scratch_for_data_processing/) NEVER upload a huge amount of files; instead, upload a big compressed file (you can process the data later in your own scratch space)
- ‚¨ÜÔ∏è **Updating of both servers?** You don't need to make the content of the two server exactly the same, but consistent.
- üó≥  [GDPR regulation](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/when-your-project-handles-personal-data/) Basically you don't need to take extra actions (the GDPR form was filled out when applying for the space)


## 5. Dataset credits
